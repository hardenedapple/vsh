Name: Next command 2
No-After-Newline:
No-Before-Newline:

Moving when there is no next prompt moves to end of buffer.

N.b. I'm using the no-newline things in order to be able to represent point
going to the end of the buffer.

Name: Next command 4
No-After-Newline:
No-Before-Newline:

Checking special case when the prompt is the last line in the buffer.

The decision to put the cursor at the start of the *current* command if moving
forward and this line is at the very end of the file was mostly made because
that was how the first function I wrote behaves and it doesn't seem like a
problem.

It would be nice to make the function behave the most logically consistent
(something like always moving forwards), but for now this seems nice enough.
